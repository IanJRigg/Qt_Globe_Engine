# Qt Globe Engine
This is conversion of an old OpenGL Globe Engine to use Qt Version 6 instead of a basic OpenGL windowing library. The Globe is rendered using the subdivided cube algorithm, with a transformed equirectangular image from the Blue Marble dataset rendered via the cubemap strategy.

This project is in progress as I work through getting Qt and OpenGL to work together.
